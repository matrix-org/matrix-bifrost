Features implemented:
- Fetching of MUC occupant avatars for matrix side of the gateway
- Implementing handling of MUC avatars to set the Matrix room avatar
- Implement logics and facilities to fetch pictures off Matrix profiles and create and store hashes that require to be appended to presences to advertise avatar availability XMPP side of the gateway

Issues fixed:
- Attempt fixing mxID unescaping function to better handle multibyte chars
- Fix storage method getRoomsOfType() as it didn't handle correctly anything but group rooms
- Make sure xmppWriteToStream() always passes a string both when writing to the stream and buffering stanzas, as passing an element now causes promises to break.
